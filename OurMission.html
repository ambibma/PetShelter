  <p>Since 1912 Pappy has lived on his farm. One day, while working the coalmines in Illinois, a he discovered he was being followed by a furry friend. Covered in coal dust, Pappy rescued the little feller and took him back to his home stead. He nurtured it back to live with evaporated milk and pickled eggs. Pappy did not have much, but he had enough. Since then, Pappy founded Pappy's Happy Hands Pet Shelter, a safe haven for resuce pups. </p>
